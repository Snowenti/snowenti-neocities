            <p>Hello!! This is the first update that im going to do, and I plan on doing recaps of my month and also having this act as a changelog for the website!</p>
            <h3>Updates</h3>
            <p>March 2023 didnt have that many things happening, I think the main thing that was really fun for me was being in a choir concert. This was my first time singing alto, and it was... interesting to say the least. I also learned a <i>lot</i> of css and html, and here I am now on neocities. </p>
